In this demo, you have seen how Camptocamp's DevOps Stack could be used to
deploy a standard stack on an existing Kubernetes cluster.

The DevOps Stack can go much further than this, allowing you to set up clusters
from scratch automatically. See the [set of examples](https://github.com/camptocamp/camptocamp-devops-stack/tree/master/examples).

It can also allow to manage the whole stack in a GitOps fashion by integrating into CI/CD pipeline environments.

See [the documentation](https://camptocamp.github.io/camptocamp-devops-stack) for more.
